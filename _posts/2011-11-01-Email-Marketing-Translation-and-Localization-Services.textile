Want to make the most out of your email marketing strategy? Here at *Fresh Translation*, we will give you some tips on how to raise your revenue with email marketing. 

There are more ways to utilise email marketing than you'd think! However, if you are planning to move internationally, you must first consider a few important points such as moving beyond translation. When reaching out international targets, speaking their language is not enough, therefore you need to be able to speak their culture too. This is why *localization* plays a fundamental part when internationalizing email campaigns.

1. Consider Language 

Find out whether your email recipients are willing to receive communication in English only. If so, it is important to understand nuances of the English language across different English speaking countries. For example, there are many different terms in the U.S, U.K and Australia that are exclusive to that country only. 

2. Take Personalization into account

While in some countries personalization improves open rates with recipients more likely to read material addressed to them, other cultures could consider greeting consumers by name a breach of privacy. Be aware of cultural differences! 

3. Legislation 

Laws and norms concerning email marketing may vary from country to country. For instance, in the USA, prices are often quoted free of tax. However, this may be illegal in other countries. 

The Bottom Line: Localization is the key to a successful international email marketing campaign. As you can see, when it comes to email marketing translating words isn't enough. It is necessary to combine linguistic, cultural and geographic localization.
