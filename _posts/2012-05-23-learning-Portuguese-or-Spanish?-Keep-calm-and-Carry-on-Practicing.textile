If your next goal is to <a href="http://freshtranslation.com/learning-portuguese">learn Portuguese or Spanish</a>, then let me tell you that you've set yourself a pretty realistic goal! The tips that I am gonna give you are purely based on my own experiences as a language learner and teacher. I always try to come up with new ways of making my language learning experiences more fun and effective.

First of all, let me give you the good news: Anyone can learn a new language and anyone can be extremely good at it.  Don't be upset because your secondary school French teacher told you that you'd never be good at it. In fact, we've all gone through some kind of situation that made us feel a bit uncomfortable at school. Unfortunately what happens is that the traditional school approach is telling you the wrong thing. Is basically telling you that you cannot make mistakes, when in fact making mistakes is crucial in language learning. You must make mistakes in order to improve it. This is one of the reasons why kids are able to learn a new language really fast. They are not scared of making mistakes.

My tip of the day is to *practice* as much as you can: Practice makes it perfect. When you're starting to learn Spanish or Portuguese, don't worry about getting it right all the time. What matters is to get your message across, not whether you use all the tenses and words right. You'll start out by making lots of mistakes, then fewer and fewer, until you are error free. You can either practice with a native <a href="http://freshtranslation.com/learning-portuguese">Portuguese or Spanish teacher</a> or a native speaker who will correct you every time you make a mistake. Stay tuned for more Portuguese and Spanish!
