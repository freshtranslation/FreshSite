<h2>About Fresh Translation</h2>
<p>
Fresh Translation is a newly started company founded by Caterine Apruzzese and its aim is to provide a translation service that is accessible and tailored to our customers' specific needs. Originally from Venezuela, I lived and studied in the city of Oporto in Portugal for ten years and in 2007 I moved to London to complete my education.

Before running my own translation business, I was working as an in-house translator and a marketing and consumer researcher for a Global company based in London.
