/** 
 *  FLAW{LESS} Css Framework 
 *
 *  Starter Page
 *  This is an example page that shows many of the possibilities
 *	you have by using the FLAW{LESS} Css Framework. The base layout
 *	is divided into 8 columns (in this example) for all devices.
 *	Through media queries the columns change position and width
 *	if viewed with smaller screen sizes.

/* Here we import the framework. Note that this does not
 * add any styles yet. We are using the less.js framework
 * which adds variables and mixins (behave like function calls)
 * This way the framework can provide infinite features, without
 * adding anything more than you need on your website.
 */

/* ================== SETUP THE FRAMEWORK  ==================
 * Here you can see the basic three setup variables that most
 * websites will need to set in order to use the framework.
 *
 * it is also important to set up those vars here so that all
 * imported .less files you create build upon this foundation
 */

/* The Flawless Reset is the most advanced reset mixin. You can also
 * choose eric meyers or yui reset. But if you use html5 like in this
 * example, then the flawless reset is best suited

/* ================ SPLIT UP YOUR CODE ================
 * It is highly recommended to split up your various parts
 * of custom styles for your website to improve maintainance
