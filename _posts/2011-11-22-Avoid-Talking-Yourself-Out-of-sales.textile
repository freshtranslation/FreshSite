Did you ever get the feeling that there was something lost in *translation* during your sales presentation? You're certainly not the only one.   


This is due to the fact that sales presentations usually contain a lot of "jargon" that may confuse  your potential clients. According to a study, only 3% of prospects fully understand most of the terms used in the various presentations they are given. So, how can we circumvent the problem? Simply by choosing your words wisely. This means avoiding sales or industry jargon unless your prospects have already used that term or have demonstrated that they prefer a highly technical level of conversation. Remember, you are speaking the language of the buyer, not your technical industry or competition!
