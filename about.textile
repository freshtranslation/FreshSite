Fresh Translation is a newly started translation service by Caterine Apruzzese. We translate documents and websites into Portuguese, Spanish, English and French. 

Our process is specifically tailored to give our translation the extra polished needed in areas such as technical writing, legal summaries and sales presentations. Our clients will appreciate giving customers in foreign countries the same great impression that they do at home through our translated documents or websites. 


"On a Quest To Become a Freelance Translator" is my blog where I share my personal experiences as a freelance translator as well as other curiosities related to the translation Industry.
