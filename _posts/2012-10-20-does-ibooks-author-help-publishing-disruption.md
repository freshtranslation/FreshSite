summary: We've all thought of going on a quest at some point in our lives. Mine emerged in my mind earlier this year after realizing that translation is one area that I am keen to explore in greater detail. I am currently in the process of developing myself into a freelance translation business, therefore I thought it would be a good idea to share some views on this topic.

Having just finished putting together a book with iBooks Author got me thinking. 
[Portuguese for Travelers](/learn/portuguese/) is a language book to help you some basic 
travel vocabulary.

## Does it enable Amateurs to disrupt the establishment

Educational books in paper form can be quite engaging, but the best ones often seem somewhat
constrained by the paper form. 
A lot of books have been published lately in ePub form readable using an eReader or iPad.

A great thing about the ePub format is can be read on a low end black-and-white reader or a
high resolution color tablet. You can show text and pictures. But that is about it. You can't
do much more than what can be done by a paper book. If it would just allow JavaScript in the
same vein as with web pages, we could make a bunch of great interactive experiences.

The iBooks can do much more, and finally enables us to publish interactive books. As a web
developer I could make an HTML based book do the same sort of things, but an amateur could not.
With iBooks Author you only need a moderate technical skill to use all the features.

So you can product a book without a publishing team behind you. The question becomes if the
*established publishers will pick this up*, or if it will *mainly be used by amateurs and self
publishing authors?*

The establishment is probably very invested in publishing the same content through a multitude
of channels using several formats, so the content can't be tailored to take full advantage of
the features available on a single platform.

Amateur publishers however can publish to a single platform making a dedicated book that gives
a better experience.

And what about the consumers, will they rush into this, or are they happy with status quo.

It will be interesting to see how things unfold.
