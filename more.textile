Originally from Venezuela, I lived and studied in the city of Oporto in Portugal for ten years and in 2007 I moved to London to complete my education. I hold a BA (Hons) in Spanish and French combined with Literature from the University of Westminster.  I am a full-time translator who is currently living and working in South America (I split my time between Argentina and Brazil)  and I speak Portuguese, Spanish, English and French. I was lucky enough to have lived between two different continents with huge cultural differences between them and have experimented this change in the first person. 

Fresh Translation is a newly started company founded by me and its aim is to provide a translation service that is accessible and tailored to our customers' specific needs. 

Before running my own translation business, I was working as an in-house translator and a marketing and consumer researcher for a Global company based in London. 

"On a Quest To Become a Freelance Translator" is my blog where I share my personal experiences as a freelance translator as well as other curiosities related to the translation Industry.
