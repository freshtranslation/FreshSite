If you are considering shopping for a translator, there are essentially two things to keep in mind. 

The first one is *cost vs quality*. We all love low prices. However, buying *translations* at extremely low rates (which became a common phenomenon in our industry) might mean that something is missing in the translation. I have heard of cases where the translator is paid 0.01 (USD) per target word, which to me is the equivalent of using machine translation to translate your document. Of course, when it comes to choosing a translation service, ask yourself:"Will anyone read this translation?" If the answer is no, then give yourself permission to buy the cheapest translation you can possibly find. But if the answer is yes, consider quality over price. In this case it is worth investing in a reliable translation service that provides services tailored to your needs. This may include additional services such as *proofreading* and *editing*. In my last blog post, I wrote about the importance of proofreading a translated document to avoid unwanted mistakes in the final print. I consider this stage as important as the translation itself and it should not be underestimated.

The second point, is the Amateur vs Professional debate. It is easy to find *inexpensive translation services*. However, are the translators really qualified? Being fluent in a language doesn't necessarily guarantee excellent writing skills. Unfortunately, and to make things worse, there are customers that can't tell the difference between a good translator and a bad one. As Patenttranslator writes in his blog, "translations are like sushi, sausages or Gourmet meals, most people can't tell the difference." In the end, it's all about the customers' preferences. So, next time you are looking for a translation service, remember these two points. Is it worth to sacrifice *quality* over saving a few extra pennies?
